Then, configure your Xcode with information for the Asista SDK. Locate the **Info.plist** file for your application. Right-click this file and select **Open As > Source Code**

Add the following code snippet, replacing the placeholders within the square brackets (`[]`) with your appâ€™s information from the developer dashboard. (Note: Do not include the square brackets)
